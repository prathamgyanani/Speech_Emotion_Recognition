# Speech_Emotion_Recognition
Using MLP Classifier and RAVEDESS Dataset of Kaggle we Built a Model 

# Dataset Used :- 
Kaggle Dataset (RAVEDESS Dataset) - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uwrfkaggler/ravdess-emotional-speech-audio

# About Files :- 
a.wav, b.wav, c.wav  all are testing files for testing purpose and output10.wav is used to test the output of the live recorded file through ML learning algorithm , app.py and basic.py are the flask files for the front-end and back-end , (in back-end there is some work remaining of connecting the front end with the ML model and Display Output)
